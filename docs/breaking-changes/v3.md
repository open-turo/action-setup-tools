# 🚨 Breaking Changes in v3

In **v3**, this action no longer uses custom scripts to install tools. It now
relies on **official GitHub Setup Actions**:

-   [`actions/setup-node`](https://github.com/actions/setup-node)
-   [`actions/setup-python`](https://github.com/actions/setup-python)
-   [`actions/setup-java`](https://github.com/actions/setup-java)
-   [`hashicorp/setup-terraform`](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform)

### ❗ What’s Changed

🔧 **Internal refactor only**: Custom installers such as `sdkman`, `tfenv`,
`nodenv`, and `pyenv` have been **removed** in favor of official setup actions.

---

### ✅ Inputs & Behavior

The action continues to work as before. If you rely on version files like
`.sdkmanrc` or `.nvmrc`, **no change is required**.

### 🚨 Why This Is a Breaking Change

Even though there are no user-facing API changes, this is released as a
**breaking version** to give consumers an explicit opportunity to test and adopt
this significant internal change.
